# Employee-Management

A simple employee management system website where admin can create new employees/admins and also update or delete existing employees. When an employee is created he/she needs to fill his/her personel information in the profile tab after logging in for the first time. After that the employee can see his/her personel details in the profile section. There is a search bar too (visible only to the admin) where admins can search for a particular employee. Admins can also view all the employees for a specific department.
